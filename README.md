# About Project:

There is PEFR dataset which was collected individually by ourself as Hospitals prefer privacy of the data of Asthma Patients

The dataset is in the extension .csv file 

The factors that decide the risk are TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, PM2.5, PM 10 values

PM 2.5 and PM 10 are particles present in the air which majorly decide the air density of the current location

As the Denisty and particles are present in an enormous amount , the risk for asthma patience increases

Therefore Risk is directly proportional to Particles present in air

# Working
Asthma Risk Prediction project analyzes risk in your current area

The weather conditions are fetched from iqair 

To specify Gender Enter 1 for Male, 2 for Female 

Actual PEFR of the patient should be measured and entered

The Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm will result the predicted PEFR and the risk in that particular area
